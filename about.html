          <h4>My name is Nikhil Kaul</h4>
          <br>
          <p>I am a current Senior at North Carolina State University majoring in Computer Science and Minoring in Statistics! 
            I was born in Noida, India, but moved to Cary, North Carolina in 2001, and have lived here ever since. When I am not coding or looking at data,
            I enjoy playing sports, dancing (I was on NC State's Bhangra team!), and hanging out with my family (particularly my dog Bonzo!). My favorite teams are: Carolina 
            Hurricanes, NC State sports, Carolina Panthers, and Team Solomid. I also enjoy listening and making music. I have been a percussionist for over 15 years, 
            and played snare drum in the marching band throughout high school.
            When it comes to life, I live by the mantra: </p>
          <p class="italicize"> "Be a better you than you were yesterday..."</p>
          <p> And I try to live by that every day. I just love to learn, and I will never stop learning. I try to surround myself with 
            good company so I can learn and grow as much as I can every day! My goal is to use data and analytics to solve tomorrow's 
            problems so our posterity can live in a tech-driven and sustainable world! I try my best to code with a purpose, and want my code to be clean and used 
            for good. 
          </p>
